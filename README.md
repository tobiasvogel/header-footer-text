# Header/Footer Text

Allow changing of the theme header and/or footer text easily from the dashboard

## Description

This Plugin is essentially the awesome **footer-text**-plugin by [sheabunge](https://github.com/sheabunge/footer-text) extended by the option to not only edit the footer but also the the header section easily through the dashboard.

It provides an interface in the dashboard, similar to the post edit screen, that allows you to easily change the text displayed in the footer on the front-end. After installing the plugin, add the `footer_text()` template tag to your `footer.php` theme template where you want the text to display. Likewise add the `header_text()` template tag to your `header.php` file. 

Visit the original **footer-text** plugin at [plugin homepage](https://sheabunge.com/plugins/footer-text/), or here on [Github](https://github.com/sheabunge/footer-text/).
